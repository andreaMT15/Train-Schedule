##Train Schedule App

**Developer: Andrea Minhas**

**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase, Moment.js**

For this application I created a train schedule application that utilizes Firebase to host train data including: first train time, frequency of train, train name and destination. The user is able to add new train information to the current schedule. Once the user submits the information it will store the information in Firebase and update the table accordingly. The application retrieves and manipulates the date and time information with Moment.js.
